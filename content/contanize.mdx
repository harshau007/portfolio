## Motivation

In today’s fast-paced development world, managing different technology stacks efficiently is crucial for developers. Whether you're working with Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, or Java, every project can require its own specific environment setup, configurations, and version management. Meet **Contanize**, the new application designed to simplify and streamline this process, allowing you to create isolated environments tailored to your project needs. Contanize is currently in beta but already proves to be a game-changer for developers seeking a quick and efficient environment setup.

## Why Isolated Environments Matter

For developers, switching between projects that use different versions of Node.js, Python, or other technologies can be a hassle. Not only does it require manually managing version conflicts, but it also introduces risks such as breaking dependencies. Isolated environments help developers create separate spaces for each technology stack, ensuring that each project runs in its own ecosystem without interfering with others.

This is where **Contanize** comes in, making it seamless to create and manage these environments with just a few clicks.

## Introducing Contanize

Contanize allows developers to quickly create isolated development environments with specific versions of Node.js, Go, Python, Rust, and Java. The application also provides database templates like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, making it easier to integrate back-end services into your projects.

Whether you're building a small web app or working on a large-scale microservice, Contanize simplifies the setup process, ensuring you can focus more on coding and less on configuring your environment.

## Key Features of Contanize

   1. ### Technology Stacks and Templates

      Contanize supports a wide range of technologies, including:
         - Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java (with version management)
         - Framework templates such as **NestJS**, **Next.js**, **Go+HTMX**

      When setting up a project, users can either select individual technologies or use pre-built templates. For example, you can select the **Next.js** template for a full-stack React application or the **Go+HTMX** template for lightweight Go web applications.

   2. ### Database Support

      Contanize simplifies database integration by allowing you to set up databases like **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** within the same environment. Users can specify the database name, username, and password, making it easy to manage and configure databases alongside the main application.

   3. ### Seamless Container Management

      Managing your development environment is incredibly intuitive with Contanize. Users can:
      - **Start** and **Stop** containers
      - **Delete** containers once the work is done
      - Redirect the container to a **VS Code instance** to work on the code in an isolated environment.

      Once your work is finished, Contanize allows you to delete the container without deleting its associated files, leaving your system clean and free from clutter.

   4. ### Real-time Metrics

      Stay on top of resource usage with real-time metrics provided by Contanize. Track network usage, memory consumption, and more while your containerized environments are running. This helps in ensuring that the container is running optimally without using excessive system resources.

   1. ### Creating Your First Environment:
      - Click on the **Create** button.
      - Enter the name of the container.
      - Select the technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Go, Rust).
      - Specify additional port numbers if necessary.
      - Add a volume to mount if needed.

   2. ### Using Templates:
      - For more complex projects, choose a template like **NestJS** or **Next.js**.
      - Enter the required database credentials (DB name, username, password) if applicable.

   3. ### Working in VS Code:
      - Once the container is created, redirect to a VS Code instance within your browser. This feature allows you to code directly in an isolated environment without needing to set up anything locally.

## Future Roadmap for Contanize

Although Contanize is currently in beta, there are several exciting updates on the horizon:

   - **Integration of in-built editor** for enhanced development workflows.
   - **Advanced Metrics Dashboard** to offer more granular insights into CPU, memory, and disk usage.

Stay tuned for these future improvements, as we aim to make Contanize the go-to tool for developers working with containerized environments.
